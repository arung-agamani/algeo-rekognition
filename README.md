# Algeo-Rekognition
Tugas Besar Algeo jilid 2 - Face Recognition using Euclidean Distance and Cosine Approximation.
Not to be confused with Amazon's Rekognition service, but you get the main idea.

# Description
Face recognition using euclidean distance and cosine similarity between many gradient vectors extracted from an image.
Uses OpenCV and KAZE, where the euclidean distance and cosine similarity algorithm are both hand-coded without any usage of libraries.

GUI uses Tkinter, but if possible, using Qt

# Workflow and Milestones

Milestone 1 : Extracting the vectors from the images
Milestone 2 : Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity algorithm both done.
Milestone 3 : Playing with datasets
Milestone 4 : Basic GUI
Milestone 5 : Advanced GUI and bugfixing
